# Readable Core project for Udacity React Nanodegree program

Readable is the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course. This is a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

There are separate folders for the front-end web app built with react-redux and the backend server provided by udacity.

To get app running, clone the project and then -

* Install and start the react front-end app
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

* In another terminal / cmd window, install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
